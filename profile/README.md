# About

Welcome to my roadmaps! Here, I'm sharing my personal roadmaps of what I've learned and am currently learning. These roadmaps serve as guides for self-study, outlining topics to explore in various domains.

## How to study

My preferred methods of study include:

- **Documents:** Utilizing written materials such as textbooks, tutorials, and online documentation.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Leveraging interactive learning experiences and simulations.

## Contributing

This organization is *open source*, acknowledging the dynamic nature of technology and the need for continuous adaptation. If you identify areas where topics need to be added or modified to enhance the roadmaps, your contributions are highly appreciated.

**Note:** The folders contain lists of topics to learn, but do not include the content. You'll need to explore and learn the content on your own.

*Happy learning,*

Agust√≠n Arias :)
